## Hello there!

This is the source code of [jmthornton.net](http://jmthornton.net), the
personal website of me, Jade Thornton. It showcases work I have done, provides
easy means of contact, hosts my blog [Sudo Brew](https://blog.jmthornton.net)
and serves as a sandbox for my own experiments and growth.

---

I am a self-taught web developer, perpetually learning and experimenting. This site will grow along with me, and will not be a finished product for some time. Please excuse broken links, poor loading times, missing CSS, etc. If you have any comments, feedback, suggestions or would like to contribute, please register an issue at <https://gitlab.com/raindeer/jmthornton/issues>.
