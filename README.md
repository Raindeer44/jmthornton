## Hello there!

[![js-semistandard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-semistandard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) [![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/thornjad/jmthornton/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/thornjad/jmthornton)

This is the source code of [jmthornton.net](http://jmthornton.net), the
personal website of me, Jade Thornton. It showcases work I have done, provides
easy means of contact, hosts my [blog](https://blog.jmthornton.net)
and serves as a sandbox for my own experiments and growth.

This branch is tracking the development of version 4 of my site. Goals for
version 4:

- [x] React.js
- [x] mini.css v3
- [x] Sass
- [ ] Parity with static site
- [ ] Use markdown for blog posts

I am a self-taught web developer, perpetually learning and experimenting, and this site is both a personal showcase and playground for my new skills. If you have any comments, feedback, suggestions or would like to contribute, please register an issue at <https://github.com/thornjad/jmthornton/issues>.
