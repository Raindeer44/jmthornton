## Hello there!

This is the source code of [jmthornton.net](http://jmthornton.net), home to Jade Thornton Web Development. This is my own personal website, showcasing work I have done, providing easy means of contact and hosting my personal blog [Sudo Brew](https://blog.jmthornton.net).

This website was previously hosted with GitHub Pages in the directory [raindeer44/raindeer44.github.io](https://github.com/raindeer44/raindeer44.github.io), but has since moved to a "proper" server. However, I still believe in open source projects. While the actual website will be updated more often than this repository, the site's open source-ness will remain here!

##### **This is a work in progress**

I am a self-taught web developer in the process of learning and experimenting. This site will grow along with me, and will not be a finished product for some time. So please excuse broken links, poor loading times, missing CSS, etc. If you have any comments, feedback, suggestions or would like to contribute, please shoot me an email at [jade@jmthornton.net](mailto:jade@jmthornton.net).
