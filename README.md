## Hello there!

[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/raindeer44/jmthornton/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/raindeer44/jmthornton)

This is the source code of [jmthornton.net](http://jmthornton.net), the
personal website of me, Jade Thornton. It showcases work I have done, provides
easy means of contact, hosts my [blog](https://blog.jmthornton.net)
and serves as a sandbox for my own experiments and growth.

I am a self-taught web developer, perpetually learning and experimenting, and this site is both a personal showcase and playground for my new skills. If you have any comments, feedback, suggestions or would like to contribute, please register an issue at <https://github.com/raindeer44/jmthornton/issues>.
