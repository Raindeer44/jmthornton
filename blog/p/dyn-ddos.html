Massive DDoS attacks on Dyn DNS: Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, Soundcloud and more offline 2016-10-21 15:18:43 News,ddos
<strong>Update:</strong>
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3134056/hacking/an-iot-botnet-is-partly-behind-fridays-massive-ddos-attack.html">PC World reports</a>
that at least part of the attack involved an IoT (internet of things) botnet, saying "Malware that can build botnets out of IoT devices is at least partly responsible for a massive distributed denial-of-service attack that disrupted U.S. internet
traffic on Friday, according to network security companies." \n \n<a href="https://www.dynstatus.com/">According to Dyn</a>
(the company being attacked), the second DDoS attack subsided at around 12:45 pm CDT. They report: \n<p style="padding-left: 60px;">On Friday October 21, 2016 at approximately 11:10 UTC, Dyn came under attack by a large Distributed Denial of Service
  (DDoS) attack against our Managed DNS infrastructure in the US-East region. Customers affected may have seen regional resolution failures in US-East and intermittent spikes in latency globally. Dyn’s engineers were able to successfully mitigate the
  attack at approximately 13:20 UTC, and shortly after, the attack subsided. See original status post here:

  global fashion. Affected customers may have seen intermittent resolution issues as well as increased global latency. At approximately 17:00 UTC, our engineers were again able to mitigate the attack and service was restored.</p>

\n \nThis morning I poured myself a delicious cup of coffee (which I didn't get to finish because I was running late), sat down at my computer and opened up Twitter. Or, tried to. I thought my computer was being fussy with WiFi again, as it does, but
most everything else was working fine... Except GitHub... And Spotify... \n \nIt turns out, the DNS provider Dyn—which services Twitter, GitHub, etc.—was under a massive DDoS attack. The
<a href="https://www.dynstatus.com/incidents/nlr4yrr162t8">Dyn Status page</a>
reports an attack against their infrastructure beginning at 11:10 UTC (6:10 am CDT) and that they were working to mitigate it. \n \nDNS stands for the

  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span>omain
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N</span>ame
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span>ystem</a>
and is responsible for converting human-friendly domain names (like jmthornton.net) and converting them to their computer-friendly IP addresses. \n \nDDoS stands for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack">
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">d</span>istributed
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">d</span>enial
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">o</span>f
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>ervice</a>, which is a type of cyberattack which attempts to cripple servers by flooding them with useless internet traffic. Denial of service can be visualized with a simple analogy: imagine you want
to buy a scrumptious burger from the greatest burger shack in the city. However, your archnemisis didn't have his coffee today and doesn't want you to get that burger, so before you make it to the burger shack, he pays hundreds of people to go stand
in line for a burger. Now instead of just going into the restaurant, you have to wait in a huge line, so long that it's no longer worth it. You have been denied service. \n \nIn the realm of the internet, denial of service takes the form of another
computer making so many requests to a server that the server is unable to even acknowledge that a legitimate request has been made. The word "distributed" in DDoS means the attack is coming from a network of "slave" computers. This network could
contain millions of computers infected by a virus or trojan. In effect, rather than one computer making malicious requests to the server, there are a plethora of computers. Attacks like these are relatively common because, compared to other "hacker"
activities, DDoS is rather simple. \n \nHacker News reported service outages including: \n<ul>
  \n \t<li>Twitter</li>
  \n \t<li>CNN</li>
  \n \t<li>
    Etsy</li>
  \n \t<li>Netflix</li>
  \n \t<li>GitHub</li>
  \n \t<li>Soundcloud</li>
  \n \t<li>Spotify</li>
  \n \t<li>Heroku</li>
  \n \t<li>Pagerduty</li>
  \n \t<li>Shopify</li>
  \n \t<li>Intercom</li>
  \n \t<li>Reddit</li>
  \n</ul>
\n&nbsp; \n \nAt 8:20 am CDT Dyn reported that "services have been restored to normal". However, another attack started at 10:52 am CDT, which is still ongoing as of this writing. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-agencies-probing-potential-causes-165655705.html">Reuters reports</a>
the Department of Homeland Security is investigating "all potential causes" of the attack. \n \nRegardless, rest assured
