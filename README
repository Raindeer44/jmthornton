	This repository contains the source code of <https://jmthornton.net>,
	including all exp (exploratory) versions (each in its own exp-prefixed
	branch). This repository excludes some subdomains of the site which use
	external PHP projects (such as Nextcloud).

	This project is primarily a playground for my ideas and efforts, as well as
	explorations of new approaches to development and of new languages.
