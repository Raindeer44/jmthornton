## The story of this website, from the creator

Hi. I'm Jade. This is my website.

This site represents the core of who I am as a developer. It has evolved and continues to evolve with me. From a simple CodePen to what it is now, this site is my journey.

I started college at the University of Minnesota in 2014, heading for a Bachelor's Degree in chemistry and on track for osteopathic medical school. However, things didn't quite turn out. I loved the idea of helping people--as well as the prestige and money that come with practicing medicine. However, it didn't quite feel right. Then, in 2015, I took organic chemistry.

That was my wake-up call. After failing the first two midterms, I dropped the class and started looking elsewhere. It wasn't that I was scared of the difficulty, nor was I simply looking for an easier path in life. No, organic chemistry woke me up from the dream I had been in for years. It brought me to the realization that--for me--the effort required for a life in medicine was not worth the return. And so I started looking for a new path.

With the help of the University's career center, I found computer science. Suddenly it clicked. I took the first class in the intro sequence, which was what amounted to a high-level intro to programming in Python. I aced the class *and* loved it the whole time (plus I got to take it with the woman who is now my fiancee). I was hooked.

After signing up for more classes, I started to learn on my own as well. I discovered web development and started learning with FreeCodeCamp. I went through the ordeal of applying to internships and was turned down by several. So I spent my time experimenting more. I switched my main computer to Linux, wrote a CSS theme for [Voat](https://voat.co), created a Pomodoro timer for Bash, forked and deployed a UI theme for Atom, and started building a game in Unity with a friend. And, most notably, I created a website.

Part of learning with FreeCodeCamp means creating projects, which are usually made on CodePen. One such project is a one-page personal website. I made mine quickly, but thought I could do better. Moving beyond CodePen, I signed up for a GitHub account and started a GitHub Pages website. However, to challenge myself, I didn't use a Jekyll theme (like this page is built with). Instead I made the whole site from scratch, even down to writing the very first `<!DOCTYPE html>`. The site went through many changes during this period, moving from a single page to many interconnected sections. I even bought a domain name.

I had so much fun creating everything, even enjoying setting up DNS and using CloudFlare. However, I still wanted to do more, and GitHub Pages isn't really meant for what I wanted. If I had had more money, I would have loved to have set up my own personal server and gone down that route. Unfortunately, I had to settle for a service (albeit a good one). My site was moved to a new Git repository and I set up a lot of fun things, including a blog, [Sudo Brew](https://blog.jmthornton.net), as well as a personal cloud using NextCloud.

The website still isn't perfect by any means. I still have bugs (especially an annoying one on mobile browsers), and there's more to build that I haven't had time for. But that's a perfect reflection of my own path in software development. Despite shortcomings and challenges, bugs and missing features, I love what I do and I'm constantly striving to make myself better.
